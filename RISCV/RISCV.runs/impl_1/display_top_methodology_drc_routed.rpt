2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_i_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): UCLK/clk_in1, clk_i_IBUF_inst/O, clk_v_reg/C, cnt_v_reg[0]/C, cnt_v_reg[11]/C, cnt_v_reg[10]/C, cnt_v_reg[4]/C, cnt_v_reg[3]/C, cnt_v_reg[1]/C, cnt_v_reg[2]/C, cnt_v_reg[8]/C, cnt_v_reg[7]/C, cnt_v_reg[6]/C, cnt_v_reg[5]/C, cnt_v_reg[9]/C (the first 15 of 15 listed)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT clk_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
